# Travel Ireland

## Project Goals & Target Audience

Welcome to Travel Ireland. Travel Ireland provides a guide for anyone over 18 who is interested in travelling to Ireland with either friends, family, or a break by themselves to explore what Ireland has to offer, to experience the Irish culture, to make memories and capture photos of their experiences along the way.

The aim of this site is to provide information about the advertised company, including information about popular tours with nearby transportation, popular restaurants and fast food takeaways, and accommodation that are located around the popular tours. A static map will also be implemented into the web page to allow users to view places they may be interested in visiting on arrival. A contact form will also be added into the design of the website to allow users to contact us directly.

## Website Design Choices

### Colours

For the website's appearance I will be employing a colour palette that I developed with some assistance from the website "coolors.co." When deciding on the colour scheme for the travel tour website, I considered how each choice would affect the the over feel, impression and presentation of the site. So, I went with a set of contrasting hues that thought would convey my message clearly to my target audience. So, I have decided to go with a dark green shade colour for the navigation bar, background for sections content and footer (#01311A), white colour for the navigation links and main text of the web page (#FFFFFF) to maintain a consistent theme. When a user hover over the navigation links and sections of the page the dark green colour (#01311A) will change to #FF7900. The contact form will have a background colour that will contrast with the navigation bar and footer so I have chosen with a slightly lighter shade of this shade (#015228)

### Fonts

In order to pick a typeface that I believe would be appropriate for the website, I experimented with a variety of fonts that are available on the Google Fonts website. I have decided to use the sans-serif typeface 'Open Sans' for the primary body of the text because of its clean, friendly, and legible features. It is also a dyslexic friendly font. These properties make it possible for users/visitors to readily intrpret content and skim over different regions of the website without difficult. As it constrasts effectively and prevents excessive usage of the font type, I have decided to utilise the Lato font family for the header, navigation, and footer.

### Icons

When designing my travel website, I decided to use icons from the font awesome website, which can be found at (https://fontawesome.com/). I want to present symbolic messages so I will use symbols such as a bus icon to represent Transporation, others will be utilised to provide visuals for relevant sections of the webpage. I have decided to add appropriate icons to each section of the page as I want to have a theme that is consistent throughout.

### Logo

### Media Queries / Responsive Design Wireframing 

While working on my single-page website, I utilised Figma to create wireframe ideas.First I made the design layout mobile-friendly, and then I scaled it up for use on desktops and tablets.In my opinion, a single-page design is all that's needed to hook readers and get them to get information quickly and easily using the navigation bar, page scrolling, and a "return to top" button.This new function is part of my quest for a user-friendly interface.
