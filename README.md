# Travel Ireland

## Project Goals & Target Audience

Welcome to Travel Ireland. Travel Ireland provides a guide for anyone over 18 who is interested in travelling to Ireland with either friends, family, or a break by themselves to explore what Ireland has to offer, to experience the Irish culture, to make memories and capture photos of their experiences along the way.

The aim of this site is to provide information about the advertised company, including information about popular tours with nearby transportation, popular restaurants and fast food takeaways, and accommodation that are located around the popular tours. A static map will also be implemented into the web page to allow users to view places they may be interested in visiting on arrival. A contact form will also be added into the design of the website to allow users to contact us directly.

## Website Design Choices

### Colours

For the website's appearance I will be employing a colour palette that I developed with some assistance from the website "coolors.co." When deciding on the colour scheme for the travel tour website, I considered how each choice would affect the the over feel, impression and presentation of the site. So, I went with a set of contrasting hues that thought would convey my message clearly to my target audience. So, I have decided to go with a dark green shade colour for the navigation bar, background for sections content and footer (#01311A), white colour for the navigation links and main text of the web page (#FFFFFF) to maintain a consistent theme. When a user hover over the navigation links and sections of the page the dark green colour (#01311A) will change to #FF7900. The contact form will have a background colour that will contrast with the navigation bar and footer so I have chosen with a slightly lighter shade of this shade (#015228)

### Fonts

In order to pick a typeface that I believe would be appropriate for the website, I experimented with a variety of fonts that are available on the Google Fonts website. I have decided to use the sans-serif typeface 'Open Sans' for the primary body of the text because of its clean, friendly, and legible features. It is also a dyslexic friendly font. These properties make it possible for users/visitors to readily intrpret content and skim over different regions of the website without difficult. As it constrasts effectively and prevents excessive usage of the font type, I have decided to utilise the Lato font family for the header, navigation, and footer.

### Icons

When designing my travel website, I decided to use icons from the font awesome website, which can be found at (https://fontawesome.com/). I want to present symbolic messages so I will use symbols such as a bus icon to represent Transporation, others will be utilised to provide visuals for relevant sections of the webpage. I have decided to add appropriate icons to each section of the page as I want to have a theme that is consistent throughout.

### Logo

### Media Queries / Responsive Design Wireframing 

While working on my single-page website, I utilised Figma to create wireframe ideas.First I made the design layout mobile-friendly, and then I scaled it up for use on desktops and tablets.In my opinion, a single-page design is all that's needed to hook readers and get them to get information quickly and easily using the navigation bar, page scrolling, and a "return to top" button.This new function is part of my quest for a user-friendly interface.

## Project Features

### Current Features

#### Navigation Bar Links with Logo

This is my home section for the Travel Ireland single page website which is fully responsive across mobile screen devices max-width 448px and 479px. I have also design a responsive layout for tablet size max width 768px. Users can navigate to any section of the page by clicking on one of the navigation links and I have added a hover on effect to inform the users they are navigating over that selected section link and to provide a user-friendly experience. 

I have added hamburger style icon from font awesome to implement in the navigation for mobile screen devices and tablet devices and is hidden in laptop devices. When the user hovers over the hamburger icon the user can select a section of their choice.

![travel-ireland-nav-links-hover-effect](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114010857/215448352-321ee93a-176c-4996-a6d8-e4ffc8768467.png)



#### Home Landing Page

The home landing page provides a static image with welcoming text directly underneath to avoid the user becoming overwhelmed with too much animations and effects at this stage of the single page site. A welcoming text intrigues the user to the site and sets a first impression before other content is viewed on the page, sustaining an interest for the user.

#### About Section

The About Us section includes an introduction to the site with information about what Travel Ireland offers and how we can help users gain a worthwhile opportunity

![travel-ireland-about-us-section](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114010857/215448468-1d4ed150-801a-4c07-90b2-aae4f8bcf835.png)

#### Tours Section 

The Tours section is consistent with the about us section as it help maintain focus and sets a tone for further content. Within the tours section I have added a description of what the tours has to offer for the user and allow the user to maintain interest to scroll down to available tour packages. I have also include a tour centred image to avoid overwhelming of text and add a friendly tone before reaching the popular tours section.

Within the popular tours section itself I have decided to create 3 (horizontal) x 2 (vertical) CSS grid layout as I wanted to ensure I was able to display the content on mobile and tablet devices easily. Having implemented this feature within my web page I also believe the content is very intriguing and easy to read which adds accessibility and user-friendly components to the section.

I have also added a grid inspired gallery section which my main aim was to set user-friendly tone again as the user will stay interested and scroll to other sections of the page. The grid layout again I believe is aesthetically appealing and responsive for all screen devices.

#### Transport Section

The transport again has a grid layout for consistency and users can view on all screen devices. I have also included a clear static map to allow users to gain insight to nearby locations to their preferred tour package and plan ahead on arrival to areas they wish to visit. The map is also responsive on all screen devices

![travel-ireland-transport-section ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114010857/215448818-c0f34fb7-8197-4244-87e9-4f7f68ce706e.png)

#### Food / Restaurants / Dining Section

The restaurant section has a consistent layout to the transport and popular tour sections to avoid users becoming distracted with new layout and sizes. The resturants includes information on recommended restaurants in the victincity of the selected tour package

![travel-ireland-restaurant-section](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114010857/215448939-6e88b3c2-497a-4b53-890c-c514d445cc74.png)

#### Accomodation Section 

The accommodation section has a similiar layout to the other sections and provides information for the user of recommended accommodation in close proximity to the preferred tour package

![travel-ireland-accommodation-section](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114010857/215448994-e90a30b4-c7ab-46bc-803b-e83ae80ad25c.png)

#### Contact Section

The contact us section allows users to send directly Travel Ireland a message and have implemented a hover on button to provide user interaction that the users information will send when clicked on 

![travel-ireland-contact-us-section](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114010857/215449048-95c8eaa1-edbf-4c2e-9d3c-ee2266127f5e.png)

#### Footer Section#

The footer provides social media links for the user so they can contact us at any social media. When the user clicks on one of the social media icons, a new tab will open providing user interaction and they are aware they have clicked on their prefered social media platform

![travel-ireland-footer-section-contact-us-submit button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114010857/215449097-d7720f84-e511-4355-808c-2197c7985ce0.png)

### Added Features

When the user hovers over the submit button the opacity will change to make the user aware they are about to submit their message

![travel-ireland-footer-section-contact-us-submit button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114010857/215449097-d7720f84-e511-4355-808c-2197c7985ce0.png)


I have added a subtle animation for the sections content so that if the user hovers their selected tour package content the background colour will change to #FF7900. I have decided to keep this effect displayed only on laptop devices as it I am aware this effect can be distracting on small screens hover the information is still easy to read, user-friendly and effectively adds impact on larger screen devices.
