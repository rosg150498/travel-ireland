                <p>The settlement of Rossnowlagh was given the name “Ros Neamlach,” which translates to “heavenly headland” in Irish.</p>

            <h1>Rock of Cashel (Tipperary</h1>
            <p>The Rock of Cashel, which is famous for its historical importance and is located on a magnificent outcrop of limestone 
            in the Golden Vale, is home to the most impressive cluster of mediaeval buildings that can be found anywhere in Ireland. 
            A round tower, a High Cross, a Romanesque chapel, a Gothic cathedral, an abbey, the Hall of the Vicars Choral and a Tower House 
            from the fourteen century are all included in the list of monuments that can be found here.</p>
            <p>Historically, this location served as the seat of the kings of Munster; legend has it that Saint Patrick himself travelled 
            here in an effort to convert King Aenghus to Christianity. Cashel became Brian Boru’s capital after he was appointed High King 
            there in the year 978 and made it his seat of government.</p>
            <p>The buildings that have been preserved are quite remarkable. For example, the frescoes at Cormac’s Chapel are the only 
            Romanesque frescoes that have been preserved in Ireland.</p>
